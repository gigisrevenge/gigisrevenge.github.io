                            <p class="blog-text">Over the long weekend I sat down and coded a portfolio website from scratch and it was really really really fun. It's something I've wanted, and indeed attempted, to do several times, but it wasn't until a bunch of Things Happened in the past couple of months that I really locked tf in, abandoned any ideas of perfection, and stopped being so scared to try. One of the Things that Happened was that I've been watching my ex who is also still my bestie <a href="https://www.instagram.com/c00chie__boi/">@c00chie__boi</a> absolutely body manifesting their dreams and ideals into real tangible art and community (keep an eye out for their forthcoming co-created trans zine its going to be the best thing you've ever read) and it was really inspiring and also made me a little bit jealous. Similarly <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jane.ey/">@jane.ey's</a> beautiful and endless luddite-coded curiosity about the potential of tech really showed me the power of p5.js and fearless imagining. Another Thing that pushed me to make this site was the spectre of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sophiep_y/">@sophiep_y</a> as she exists in my head (shoutouttttt) A Christmas Carol-ing me into action (she sent me one text two months ago about how if I'm gonna go freelance I need a website and it's haunted my reminders app since).  I've also been reading a lot of really brilliant writing that has inspired me to be less scared of trying to publicly make meaning out of my own experiences and just say fuck it we blog, specifically <a href="erin_j_riley">@erin_j_riley</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/taylorlorenz/">@taylorlorenz</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ellerustle/">@ellerustle</a>, and all the quote tiles on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thecreativeindependent/">@thecreativeindependent</a> lol.  Finally lowkey the world is ending so now's as good a time as any to Manifest and Express and just like be that bitch, if I want it I go get it yk.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="blog-text">Anyway my site is still in it's very iterative stages, and I'm not sure quite exactly what it is for. Technically it's a portfolio to spruik my work to people who might want to ?pay me? to ?make stuff?. But also the past year I've been thinking a lot about social media, digital networks, and data sovereignty: lowkey the state of the internet is highkey fucked right now. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dmneeque/">@dmneeque</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/g1rltwink/">@g1rltwink</a> and I have been experimenting with ditching Meta in favour of Discord, and I also started a server for the digital-minded girlies in aus (if u wanna join hmu). Federated social media also seems to maybe be onto something? These experiments are ongoing, with varying degrees of success (Discord announced a couple of weeks ago it's going public so there's probably only limited time left before enshittification sets in (see: what happened / is happening to Reddit)). I'm learning the pull of Instagram's network effect is very strong, and the effort, intention, and risk of moving elsewhere, while not immense, is not nothing either, and usually most of us are just too busy to gaf.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="blog-text">It's really important to me in making things that intent, form and content all align (invaluable learnings from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_aakkaa/">@_aakkaa</a> in the nuance of doing so) so my website is I guess supposed to be in part a manifestation of what I think the internet should/could be like. I wasn't alive in 1999 but that vibe.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="blog-text">This is potentially much ado about nothing (you're on the site right now, you can see it's very basic lol) but these are my thoughts. This was supposed to just be a hire me to make stuff post lol, so hire me, digital producer @gigis_revenge_, to make stuff!!</p>
